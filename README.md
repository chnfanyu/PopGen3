# PopGen3

## Introduction

**PopGen** is a state-of-the-art open-source synthetic population generator for advanced travel demand modeling. Developed under the guidance of Professor Ram M. Pendyala at Arizona State University, PopGen utilizes a heuristic algorithm (IPU) to control and match both household-level and person-level attribute distributions.

## Key Updates

- Advanced control of household and person variables across multiple geographic resolutions (region and geo).
- Command-line interface for simplified usage and enhanced computational efficiency.
- Fully compatible with Python 3, with updated dependencies.
